# B.Tech
This repository contains all the projects, assignments, and scripts I developed during my B.Tech journey. It includes coursework projects, practice programs, small utilities, and experimental code across different subjects. The goal of this repo is to document my learning, track progress, and provide reference material for myself and others.
